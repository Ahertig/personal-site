        Coder Notes is a free, open-source notebook designed for coders.

        The Coder Notes interface formats code appropriately with Angular Markdown and HighlightJS, which is a huge leg up on Evernote, where code is formatted exactly as the rest of the text. Coders can organize notes by tag or notebook and—rather than toggling to a repl.it window—can execute code directly within the note with the help of Tonic, a sandboxed NodeJS environment.
