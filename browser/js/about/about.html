      I love to code. I'm proficient in Javascript, Node.js, Angular, and MongoDB, and am always searching for new projects. I'm currently looking for a position as a software developer.

      As a technology journalist, I wrote about a variety of technology topics, including projects at Qualcomm and hackers trying to build a better Internet. (See, for example, this VICE article on how bitcoin might make <a href="">distributing a basic income easier</a>.)

      I like animals and attending experimental concerts.
